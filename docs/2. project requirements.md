# Project Requirements
A simple market where products under categories are created and retrieved through search
## Functional Requirements
1. Registration
   1. Users must be able to register an account with a username and password
   2. The system must only accept passwords between 8 and 72 characters long
   3. The system must only accept usernames between 4 and 64 characters long
   4. The system must only accept usernames that are distinct from existing usernames in the database
   5. The system must produce a unique user_id
2. Login
   1. Registered users must be able to create a session and receive a session token
3. Search (Authenticated endpoint)
   1. The system must allow users to search based on category or natural language keywords
   2. The system must provide paginated list of items of 20 items each
   3. The user must be able to sort by price
4. Product (Authenticated endpoint)
   1. The product endpoint must provide name, price, categories and description
   2. The system must allow users to create product entries
5. Category (Authenticated endpoint)
   1. The system must allow users to create new categories
## Non-functional Requirements
1. Security 
   1. Login endpoint should take approximately the same time to prevent timing attacks
   2. Passwords should be hashed and salted using the blowfish algorithm in B-crypt using appropriate costs to reasonably prevent brute force and rainbow attacks
   3. Authenticated endpoints should only be accessible by users with valid JWT session tokens in their cookies
   4. JWT session cookies should only be valid for 1 hour
2. Performance
   1. Login should take no more than 100 ms at 3000 rps
   2. All other endpoints should take no more than 1000 ms
3. Availability
   1. Login should be able to support at least 3000 rps given a 4 core cpu
